## DESCRIPTION

Adapter for [gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) to use [Rugged](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged) at the backend. See https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/886.

## CONTRIBUTING

You can contribute by helping to ensure that the [git adapter specs](https://github.com/gollum/adapter_specs) pass (run `bundle exec rake`). In the future, we also need to make sure that the [gollum-lib](https://github.com/gollum/gollum-lib) specs pass when using this adapter as a backend.
